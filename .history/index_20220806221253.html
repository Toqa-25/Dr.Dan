        <p>  Dr. Dan Neundorf created and taught a leadership program for our company that captured the minds and hearts of the people that went through it. The program has had an incredibly positive impact on the performance culture 
          of our organization. The value of the program to the company and our employees is immeasurable. It allows us to attract, develop and sustain top talent. Students of this program are grateful for the investment that is made
          in them and become more committed to their own success as leaders as well as the success of the company. An awareness is created on how the different departments fit together which allow for strategies to be developed that
          are highly customer centric and create the ability to leverage knowledge and success from throughout the organization. Dan’s program is a unique program that has a rate of return that most other leadership programs and companies could only hope for.

      <p>  Dr. Dan is one of the best mentors and instructors I have met. He is able to quickly find and understand students needs and deliver material to meet the needs of everyone in a class. As a mentor, he is very high cognitive 
        and is able to ask the right questions and offer insightful advice to immediately create opportunities for self discovery. Away from the office, I am the President of a not-for-profit daycare. Dan volunteered his time and 
        expertise to run a workshop on Myers-Briggs and communication at our award winning centre. The 21 staff entered the evening class reluctantly and left the class bouncing with energy and talking excitedly about the benefits 
        of Myers-Briggs. In this one and only meeting with a class of 21. Dan was able to understand individual needs, create and deliver a high impact learning experience for everyone. I think Dan is great.

      <p>	Integrity, passion and excellence. Those are the 3 things that Dr. Dan Neundorf brings to everything he does. I have had the pleasure of participating in one of Dan’s programs. It had been awhile since I felt truly engaged in

      <p>   I approached Dan to provide me with some personal coaching early on in my career and his personable and professional style of teacher and coach allowed me to understand myself and how I relate and create opportunities with 
        others. Every time I interact with Dan I come away feeling refreshed, energized and motivated to do my job with more passion.’ I requested Dan to perform a workshop with my current team and the session was an interactive day
        of a-ha moments with a genuine interest in the room. We left with useful observational tools and techniques that could be used immediately in our day to day activities in business and at home.</p>

        personalities. He has a profound gift for understanding both people and multifaceted organizations. His depth of knowledge into personalities and how people think and will react is very impressive. Dan’s advice is sage
        and is a perfect match for his enthusiastic approach to coaching. I have found Dan to be extremely flexible whenever his support has been needed outside of pre-scheduled meetings. I have developed a deep level of trust
        with Dan and respect his counsel. He has a wealth of knowledge and he’s truly gifted in bringing clarity to a situation. Dan’s impact has been profound and I look forward to our continued partnership.
